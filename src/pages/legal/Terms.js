          "post") information, text, graphics, photograph, audio, video,
          postings, reviews, designs, inventions, or other materials ("User
          Content") that may or may not be viewable by other Users. User Content
          must comply with these Terms.
        </p>
        <p>
          You retain ownership of all intellectual property rights you have in
          the User Content you post on the Service. By posting User Content on
          or through the Service, you grant Woto a worldwide, irrevocable,
          perpetual, non-exclusive, transferable, royalty-free license (with the
          right to sublicense) to use, copy, reproduce, process, adapt, modify,
          publish, transmit, display, distribute, and otherwise exploit such
          User Content in any format or medium now known or developed in the

          Your User Content will not be used for publicity, advertising, or any
          public statements without your prior consent. In the interest of
          clarity, the license granted to Woto shall survive termination of the

          in User Content and for avoidance of doubt, our use and retention of
          your personal data, including any that is contained in User Content,

          that you post.

        <p>
          You agree that this license includes the right for other Users with
          permitted access to your User Content to use your User Content in

          the functionality of the Service.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your User Content will be viewable by other Users of the Service. You

          others under these Terms. You are fully responsible for Your Content.
          You may not copy, upload, download, or share Your Content unless you
          have the appropriate rights to do so. Woto takes no responsibility and
          assumes no liability for any User Content that you or any other User
          or third- party posts. You agree that Woto is only acting as a passive
          conduit for your online distribution and publication of your User
          Content. It is your responsibility to ensure that Your Content abides
          by applicable laws, these Terms, and with our{" "}

          under equity or law if you post any User Content that violates these
          Terms or we consider to be objectionable for any reason. You agree
          that Woto may proofread, summarize, or otherwise edit and/or withdraw
          your User Content (but does not assume the obligation), and you
          understand it remains your sole responsibility to monitor your User
          Content and ensure that such edited content is accurate and consistent
          with your representations and warranties in these Terms.

          User Content, and that by using the Service, you may be exposed to
          User Content from other Users that is offensive, indecent, inaccurate,
          misleading, or otherwise objectionable. Please also note that User
          Content may contain typographical or other inadvertent errors or

          designate a reasonable period of time after which the new Terms will
          take effect. If you disagree with our changes, then you should stop
          using Woto within the designated notice period. Your continued use of
          Wotos will be subject to the new Terms. However, any dispute that

          <strong>FERPA Policy</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          This section applies only to those Users who access the Service in
          connection with classes offered by an educational agency or
          institution (the "School") that is subject to the Family Educational
          Rights and Privacy Act (“FERPA”). If you are a School or School
          representative, Woto acknowledges that School data may include
          personally identifiable information from education records that are
          subject to FERPA (“FERPA Records”). To the extent that Woto receives
          FERPA Records in providing the Service, you agree Woto functions as a
          “school official” as defined in 34 CFR § 99.31(a)(1)(i). Both parties
          agree to protect personally identifiable information from education
          records in accordance with FERPA and any applicable School policy. The
          limitations set forth in this section shall not apply to information
          which Woto receives pursuant to consent of student User’s parent or
          guardian or a student User who is at least 18 years of age or the age
          of majority in such User’s jurisdiction of residence. To the extent
          permitted by law, nothing contained herein shall be construed as
          precluding either party from releasing such information to the other
          so that each can perform its respective responsibilities. The School
          shall advise Woto whenever any students have provided consent to
          release information to an extent broader than as provided for by FERPA
          or any applicable School policy.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Service is not a part of or endorsed by the School. If you create
          a class, you represent and warrant that the School associated with or
          created for such class is valid and that you are validly affiliated
          with the School.

          <strong>Disclaimer of Warranties</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Woto makes no warranties of any kind with respect to Woto or your use
          of the Services.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Limitation of Liability</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Woto shall not have any liability for any indirect, incidental,
          consequential, special, exemplary, or damages under any theory of
          liability arising out of, or relating to, these Terms or your use of
          Woto.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Indemnification</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          You will indemnify, defend, and hold Woto, its subsidiaries,
          affiliates, officers, and employees, harmless from any and all claims,
          damages, losses, liabilities, actions, judgments, costs, and expenses
          (including reasonable attorneys' fees) brought by a third party
          arising out of or in connection with: (i) any act or omission by you,
          in connection with your use of Woto or (ii) your breach or alleged
          breach of any of these Terms. Woto may, at its option, elect to take
          over control of the defense and settlement of a claim subject to
          indemnification. You agree not to settle any such claim without the
          prior written consent of Woto.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Arbitration Agreement</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          We both agree to resolve any disputes arising out of these Terms or
          your use of Woto through final and binding arbitration. Arbitration is
          a less formal procedure than a lawsuit in court, with the goal of
          resolving disputes more quickly. We both agree to waive our rights to
          have our claims decided by a judge or jury. Instead, the arbitration
          shall be finally settled in accordance with the Comprehensive
          Arbitration Rules of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Service,
          Inc. ("JAMS") by three arbitrators appointed in accordance with the
          Rules. The arbitration will be held in the United States county where
          you live or work, San Francisco (CA), or any other location we agree
          to, and shall be conducted in the English language. The arbitrators'
          decision may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction. Woto
          will pay all arbitration fees if the case is a non-frivolous case .
          The prevailing party shall be entitled to costs and attorneys' fees,
          but Woto will not seek its attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration
          unless the arbitrators determine that your claim is frivolous.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate.</em> Claims for injunctive
          or equitable relief or claims regarding intellectual property rights
          may be brought in any competent court without the posting of a bond.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>No Class Actions: </em>You may resolve disputes with us only on an
          individual basis; you may not bring a claim as a plaintiff or a class
          member in a class, consolidated, or representative action. Class
          arbitrations, class actions, private attorney general actions, and
          consolidation with other arbitrations are not permitted.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Governing Law</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          You agree that these Terms, and your use of Woto, are governed by the
          Federal Law of the United States of America, without regard to its
          principles of conflicts of law.
