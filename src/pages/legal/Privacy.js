          CCPA Rights. California residents can make certain requests about
          their personal information under the CCPA. Specifically, if you are a
          California resident, you may request that we:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            provide you with information about: the categories of personal
            information we collect, disclose or sell about you; the categories
            of sources of such information; the business or commercial purpose
            for collecting or selling your personal information; and the
            categories of third parties with whom we share personal information.
            Such information is also set forth in this Privacy Policy.
          </li>
          <li>
            provide access to and/or a copy of certain information we hold about
            you;
          </li>
          <li>delete certain information we have about you; and/or</li>

            offer to you, if any.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Please note that certain information may be exempt from such requests
          under applicable law. For example, we may retain certain information
          for legal compliance and to secure our Services. We may need certain
          information in order to provide the Services to you; if you ask us to
          delete it, you may no longer be able to use the Services.
        </p>
        <p>
          The CCPA further provides you with the right to not be discriminated
          against (as provided for in applicable law) for exercising your rights
          under the CCPA.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shine the Light Disclosure. The California &ldquo;Shine the
          Light&rdquo; law gives residents of California the right under certain
          circumstances to request information from us regarding the manner in
          which we share certain categories of personal information (as defined
          in the Shine the Light law) with third parties for their direct
          marketing purposes. We do not share your personal information with
          third parties for their own direct marketing purposes without your
          consent.
